            <p>Saltydog’s Saloon was founded by Chad "Saltydog" Saltikov, a man whose love for his family and the open water sparked a dream that would become a beloved gathering spot for all. Inspired by the countless hours spent fishing with his son, Simon, Chad learned that it wasn’t just about the catch—it was about the moments spent together on the water. Those quiet mornings, filled with conversation and laughter, became the foundation for Chad’s vision of a place where people could come together, enjoy good food, and create memories with the ones they love. This vision turned into Saltydog’s Saloon—a place where the spirit of family and tradition lives on in every meal and every toast.</p>
            <p>More than just a saloon, Saltydog’s is a reflection of the values Chad cherished most: family, tradition, and the joy of sharing life’s simple pleasures. From the nautical-inspired decor to the warm, inviting atmosphere, every detail of the saloon reflects the love and connection that Chad and Simon shared during their fishing trips. Whether it’s enjoying a drink with friends or a meal with family, Saltydog’s Saloon is a place where everyone can unwind, enjoy great food, and feel at home.</p>
            <p>Today, Simon carries forward his father’s legacy, continuing the tradition of hospitality and warmth that Chad envisioned. As the heart and soul of Saltydog’s Saloon, Simon has worked to preserve the welcoming environment his father created, while ensuring that every guest feels like part of the family. Whether you’re here for a quick bite or a special celebration, we invite you to join us at Saltydog’s—where memories are made, stories are shared, and the tradition of family continues to thrive.</p>
