        <h1>Clarendon vs. Sutro </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Clarendon</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Clarendon is a classic slab serif typeface originally designed in 1845 by Robert Besley for the London-based foundry Thorowgood & Co. It was created during the Industrial Revolution, a time period when bold and readable fonts became essential for advertising, posters, and signage. The design was characterized by thick, block-like serifs and sturdy proportions, making it good for large display text. Clarendon quickly gained popularity, particularly in the United States, after being adopted by the American Type Founders in the late 1800s. Its boldness made it a favorite in headlines, advertisements, and posters.Clarendon was the first typeface to be patented.
				In the 20th century, Clarendon fell somewhat out of use but was revived in the 1960s and 1970s as part of a trend toward vintage and retro typography. Adobe’s version of Clarendon, created in the 1980s by Sumner Stone, brought the typeface into the digital age, preserving its iconic look while adapting it for modern use. Today, Clarendon remains a widely used and highly regarded typeface, known for its strength and timeless appeal in both print and digital media. It continues to be favored in a variety of design applications, from branding and packaging to editorial work.

			 <h3>Sutro</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Sutro is a serif typeface designed by Ed Benguiat in 1991, inspired by the iconic Sutro Baths in San Francisco. The baths were known for their grand architecture and distinctive signage, which influenced Benguiat’s design. The typeface blends traditional and modern elements, featuring strong, elegant serifs and a refined, legible structure. Sutro was intended to capture the essence of San Francisco’s unique historical and architectural identity, resulting in a typeface with a timeless, sophisticated appearance.
				In the 1990s, Adobe helped bring Sutro into the digital age, making it widely available for use in both print and digital applications. The typeface’s versatility, with its clear legibility in both display and body text sizes, has made it a popular choice for a range of design projects. Its combination of old-style influences and modern proportions continues to make it a highly regarded font for branding, editorial design, and other professional uses.

			<h2>Comparison</h2>

			<h3>Similarities</h3>

				<figcaption>Similarities between Clarendon and Sutro</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Both fonts have serifs on their letters and have relatively even letters. The spacing between letters is fairly similar despite the different X heights. The “g” and “a” in each font is indicative of old style type with the “g” as a two-story letter, as well in its stress and shape. Both font’s “R” have a tail that swoops upwards. Both font’s bases on the letter “g” are the same.In terms of punctuation, the exclamation points sit on the same baseline.

             <h3>Differences</h3>

				<figcaption>Type comparison between Sutro vs Clarendon</figcaption>
				<p>Despite both fonts being slab serif, there are a handful of differences that set the two type families apart. As you can see by the type diagram up top, Clarendon is way more strict when it comes to sticking to the x and ascender height. The letters fit perfectly into their boundaries while the Sutro letters sometimes peak out slightly above the x-height and ascender line. Good examples of this would be the ‘o’, ‘d’, ‘l’, and ‘e’ in ‘Handgloves’. There is a rounded terminal on the ‘a’ in Clarendon and an ear on ‘g’, but not in Sutro. The Sutro typeface seems more angular and pointy overall as we can see through the inside of the ‘a’ and the serif style on the ‘R’.  Clarendon is also noticeably thicker than Sutro as well, signifying that it takes more width than length. Through the letter comparison, we can see that the uppercase ‘R’ and lowercase ‘o’ show that Claredon is a wider font while Sutro is a more lengthy one. This also makes the fonts’ counters differ greatly in length and width.</p>
